# Vannevar
A punny homage to Vannevar Bush that will provide Variant Annotation for human molecular genetic (mostly NGS) result reporting


This repository will start as a series of shell scripts that run on MacOS High Sierra and progress to a series of python scripts
that use an sql server (eg mysql, but that is only an example) in conjunction with sql query that can annotate patient reports.

This repository was started in the spirit of public cooperation for genetic annotation.
